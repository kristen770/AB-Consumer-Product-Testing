### Project Overview 
This is a 24 case study on Hypothesis Testing given mid Statistics Module (Module 2) at the Flatiron School. 

### Business Senario 
You are a DS working for Northwind, a supplier company. Your job is find interesting relationships in their database. 

### Question 1: there a difference in quantity of products sold by discount rate?  
For this question I want to look at one specific product sold by one distributor to a deliverable insight recommendation on how that producer should price their product. After some general exploration I decided to focus on Outback Lager sold at 15$ unit price by Pavlova, Ltd.  

### Investigation on Quantity Sold by Discount Percentage 
I conducted Welch's Ttest, Bootstrapping and calcualted pvales for the quantity sold of this product at to 0.00% discount rate, the 0.33% discount rate, the 1.33% discount rate and the 1.67% discount rate. 

For each experiments I falied to reject the null hypothesis. 

### Conclusion 
I failed to reject the null hypothesis at 0.00, 0.33, 1.33, and 1.67 % discount rate. This leads me to believe there is little correlation between discount rate and quantity sold I turn I would provide the recommendation that Pavlov, Ltd should stop discounting their Outback Lager as it does not lead to higher sales.
